# DataWrangling
This repository will contain all the necessary files and work for project 4 for my data science course. For this project I was tasked with gathering, assessing and cleaning data that I collect from "WeRateDogs" Twitter page, a page which rates pictures and videos of dogs.

There are three files that we will collect the data from.

1. CSV file that has archived data collected from the page
2. TSV file that has image prediction results performed on the dogs images.
3. JSON file that is collected using Twitter API to collect additional information.

After cleaning and merging everything together I will performed some analysis and visualization to get a better understanding of the data I have.
